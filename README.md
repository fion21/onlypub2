## Questions interactive with double click and score counter system for correct/incorrect answers
```
At this stage of the project I have not called from a separate API, just using hard coding to test as is. The calls bring pages 1-3 and update the score for the correct question.
Left to fix: Numbering from intergers to letters in the counter system

### What remains
Calling from a separate API
Creating a login system
Creating a way to display the information as a 'live' site via github's link facility
Possiblly depoying to Heroku or Netlify to see as a live site
Using Axios to call the API
Reducing size to a build edition
