# Creating the Login Screen and Joining a Multi-Player Quiz

## Connecting a Backend
```
I previously set up login credetials with `Firebase` which works well with `Vue` as a cloud based SaaS to host whatever backend data semantics we seek to store or retrieve, however after much trial and error, I have decided to look into `SocketIO`, as no password authenticaion is required in this project.
